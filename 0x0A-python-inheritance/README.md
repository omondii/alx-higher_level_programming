Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that
allows you to create new classes based on existing classes. In Python, you can
create a new class, known as the derived or child class, by inheriting from an
existing class, known as the base or parent class. The derived class inherits
the attributes and methods of the base class, and you can add or modify them as
needed.
